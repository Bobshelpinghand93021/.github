Hello! First let me start by saying you are loved and blessed beyond all measure. With that being said are you tired of overpaying movers everytime you need something moved. Thats why we are here. We want to help you save money, get your move done, and be on your way to greater achievements. 
So you got a friend whos been having a hard time right. He down on his luck only got minimum time and money to move. That guy needs help and I charge my brothers to get that person in touch with me. A helping hand in the right place can go a long way
You can look me up on facebook, yelp,thumbtack, moving helper and Google plus maps. We are friendly, fast, reliable and honest.
Small fact about us at Bob's Helping Hand is we drink iced coffee for a boost and love to eat power bars for breakfast
